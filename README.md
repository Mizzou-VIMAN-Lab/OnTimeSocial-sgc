# Writing and Visualizing Simulated Data on DynamoDB
Follow the following steps to simulate EEG data for 1 user, write it into a dynamodb table called "myDB" and visualize it on the web server
Assumption: You already have an AWS account created and you have your access key ID and access secret stored securely on your system

1. wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/how-to-use-controller/visualApp.tar.gz
2. tar -xvzf visualApp.tar.gz
3. Download apache maven by first running a "sudo apt-get update" command and then "sudo apt-get install maven" command
4. Make sure your Java_home is set to jdk. If not, download from "https://s3.amazonaws.com/how-to-use-controller/jdk-8u181-linux-x64.tar.gz", unzip and save in /usr/lib/jvm and export java_home to the address of jdk and add the same address to PATH.

Run the following 2 sets of commands on 2 separate terminals
a. cd visualApp
    MAVEN_OPTS="-Daws.accessKeyId=your_access_key -Daws.secretKey=your_secret_key" mvn
compile -PdbWriter exec:java

b. cd visualApp
    MAVEN_OPTS="-Daws.accessKeyId=your_access_key -Daws.secretKey=your_secret_key" mvn
compile -Pwebserver exec:java

Open your browser and go to "ipaddress:8080" to view the visualization of simulated EEG data for 1 user. 

To change the number of users:
a) Open visualApp/src/main/java/org/example/basicApp/ddb/DynamoDBWriter.java

b) Line 70, change numUsers=1 to 5, 10, etc.

# OnTimeSocial

Follow the following steps to install OnTimeSocial, a HumHub-based Social Portal designed for providing assistance to remote instructors in creating, managing and tracking VR sessions. The portal was designed with the usecase of vSocial, a VR Learning environment for children with Autism.

# This portal is installed in command line

1. Install Lamp Server
    sudo apt-get install lamp-server^
# Save the 'root' password as 'admin'

2. Install the various php libraries that HumHub requires. 
    sudo apt-get install php-zip php-gd php-intl php-curl php-mbstring
    
3. MySQL Database settings
    mysql -u root -p (password: admin)
    create database humhub;
    create user 'humhub'@'localhost' identified by '123456';
    grant all on humhub.* to 'humhub'@'localhost' identified by '123456';
    flush privileges;
    exit;
# It is important to remember the 'humhub' user's password as it is later used to setup the portal on the User Interface


4. Git Clone our customized web portal
    cd /var/www/html/
    sudo git clone https://github.com/sainuguri/HumHub-vSocial.git
    sudo mv HumHub-vSocial humhub
    cd humhub
    mysql -u root -p humhub<Dump.sql

# To make sure you can view the visualization, Edit the file  “™\humhub\modules\session\views\eeg\index.php”, Replace the div “container” with the following scripts:

< div >
           	< object type=”text/html” data=”http://ip-address-of-your-instance:8080” width=”1600px” height=”1200px” style=”overflow:auto;border:5px ridge blue” >< / object >
< / div >


# Then run “sudo systemctl restart apache2”

5. Restart Apache2
sudo systemctl restart apache2

# Configured settings:  
# Hostname: localhost
# MySQL username: humhub
# MySQL password: 123456
# Database: humhub

# Login details:
username: saisn.67
password: 123456

# Go to the web browser and open "your-ip-address/humhub" and login with the above details (you can create or update username/password). Our customization, on to of HumHub social portal's features, includes: 
- Rewards page: To keep track of the progress of each student during a session
- Session Tracking: Allows the instructor to create a session, invite students and allows the instructor to set the rewards of each student and to monitor the EEG-converted-to-emotions levels of each student during the session.


# We are working on "Automating" this process using Docker containers.
